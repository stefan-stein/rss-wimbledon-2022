In this document we're interested in generating predictions for every pairing, using Elo scores alone.
We don't expect this to do terribly well, but it's a baseline.

Let's read in the Elo ratings we downloaded from the Web.

```{r}
elo_m <- read.csv('data/elo_ratings/atp22.csv')
head(elo_m)
```

According to the web site, the `gElo` column is a 50/50 average between the all-surfaces Elo score and the grass-only Elo score.
That's their recommendation, though we may or may not follow it.

We can convert Elo scores to Bradley--Terry abilities.
Let \(a_i\) represent the Elo score of player \(i\).
Then the probability that player \(i\) defeats player \(j\) (ignoring the possibility of a draw) is given by

\[
p_{ij} = 1 - \frac1{1 + 10^{(a_i - a_j)/400}} = \frac{10^{a_i/400}}{ 10^{a_i/400} + 10^{a_j/400}},
\]
so that
\[
\frac{p_{ij}}{p_{ji}} = \frac{10^{a_i/400}}{10^{a_j/400}},
\]
hence
\[
\ln \frac{p_{ij}}{p_{ji}} = a_i \frac{\ln 10}{400} - a_j \frac{\ln 10}{400}.
\]
Thus one can convert an Elo rating into a Bradley--Terry (log)-score by multiplying it by \(\frac1{400}\ln 10\).

```{r}
elo_prob <- function(a1, a2) {
  1 / (1 + 10^((a2 - a1) / 400))
}
```

So the probability that Carlos Alcaraz beats Novak Djokovic is

```{r}
elo_prob(elo_m[1, 'Elo'], elo_m[2, 'Elo'])
```

Now to make some predictions.
Let's pull in the template with all the pairings.
Watch out for non-Ascii letters! (Make sure to set the encoding to `UTF-8`.)

```{r}
template <- read.csv('submission-template.csv', encoding = 'UTF-8')
head(template, 10)
```

Are all the male players in our table?

```{r message=F}
library(dplyr)
men <- with(subset(template, Gender == 'M'),
            union(player1_name, player2_name))
```

Watch out for encodings or invisible unicode characters (like non-breaking spaces) in data that's scraped from the web!

I have fixed this in `webscraping.Rmd` so the following should now work.

```{r}
'novak djokovic' %in% men
tolower(elo_m$Player[2])
'novak djokovic' == tolower(elo_m$Player[2])
```

Or is it non-breaking spaces?

```{r}
stringi::stri_escape_unicode('novak djokovic')
stringi::stri_escape_unicode(elo_m$Player[2])
```

Now, who in the submission template is missing from the scraped Elo ratings?

```{r}
men[!men %in% tolower(elo_m$Player)]
```

Are they really missing?

```{r}
library(stringr)
str_subset(elo_m$Player, 'elix') # hyphens
str_subset(elo_m$Player, 'amos') # double-barrelled name
str_subset(elo_m$Player, 'oger')
str_subset(elo_m$Player, 'won') # spacing
str_subset(elo_m$Player, 'nnard') # hyphens
```

And now the same for women:

```{r}
elo_w <- read.csv('data/elo_ratings/wta22.csv')
women <- with(subset(template, Gender == 'W'),
              union(player1_name, player2_name))
women[!women %in% tolower(elo_w$Player)]
```

Diagnose the issues:

```{r}
str_subset(elo_w$Player, 'arbi') # diacritics
str_subset(elo_w$Player, 'auf')  # different forename?
str_subset(elo_w$Player, 'orne') # diacritics
str_subset(elo_w$Player, 'a ?[Gg]abr') # hyphenation
str_subset(elo_w$Player, 'elia') # hyphenation
str_subset(elo_w$Player, 'in ?[Yy]u') # spacing
```
